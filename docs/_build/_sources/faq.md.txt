# FAQ & Troubleshooting

This document answers frequently asked questions and provides solutions to common problems you may encounter while using `odoo-data-flow`.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is `odoo-data-flow`?

It is a powerful Python library designed to handle the import and export of data to and from Odoo. It allows you to define complex data transformations in Python, providing a robust and repeatable process for data migrations.

### How is this different from Odoo's standard import tool?

While Odoo's built-in import is great for simple tasks, `odoo-data-flow` offers several key advantages for complex or large-scale migrations:

- **Separation of Concerns**: It cleanly separates the data **transformation** logic (cleaning your source data) from the data **loading** logic (importing into Odoo).
- **Robust Error Handling**: Its two-pass import system intelligently handles errors, ensuring that one bad record doesn't stop the entire process.
- **Powerful Transformations**: You can use the full power of Python and a rich set of built-in `mapper` functions to handle almost any data transformation challenge.
- **Repeatability and Version Control**: Since your transformation logic is code, it can be version-controlled (with Git), tested, and reused across multiple environments (like staging and production) with confidence.

### Can I use this for both importing and exporting?

Yes. The library provides tools for both workflows. The `Processor` and `mapper` modules are used for transforming and preparing data for import, while the `odoo-data-flow export` command is used to export data from Odoo into CSV files.

### Can I migrate data directly between two Odoo databases?

Yes. The library includes a powerful `odoo-data-flow migrate` command that performs a complete export, transform, and import from one Odoo instance to another in a single step, without creating intermediate files. This is ideal for migrating data from a staging server to production.

> For detailed instructions, see the [Server-to-Server Migration Guide](guides/07_server_to_server_migration.md).

### How do I process a CSV file that has no header?

The `Processor` can be initialized directly with in-memory data. If your source file has no header, you can read it manually using Python's standard `csv` module and provide your own header list.

1.  Read the raw data from the CSV file into a list of lists.
2.  Create a Python list containing the header names in the correct order.
3.  Initialize the `Processor` using the `header=` and `data=` arguments instead of `filename=`.

```python
import csv
from odoo_data_flow.lib.transform import Processor

# 1. Define the header manually
my_header = ['LegacyID', 'FirstName', 'LastName', 'Email']
my_data = []

# 2. Read the file into a list
with open('origin/contacts_no_header.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    my_data = list(reader)

# 3. Initialize the Processor with the in-memory data
processor = Processor(header=my_header, data=my_data)

# You can now proceed with your mapping as usual
# my_mapping = {'name': mapper.concat(' ', 'FirstName', 'LastName'), ...}
```

### Where can I find a complete, real-world example?

A full example project, demonstrating a realistic data migration workflow with multiple models and complex transformations, is available on GitHub. This is an excellent resource for seeing how all the pieces fit together.

## Troubleshooting Common Errors

When an import fails, understanding why is key. Here are some of the most common issues and how to solve them.

### Understanding the `.fail` and `.fail.bis` Files

The two-pass import process is designed to isolate errors effectively.

- **`my_file.csv.fail`**: This file is created during the **first pass** of the import. It contains every record that failed for _any_ reason. This can include genuine data errors or temporary database issues like deadlocks.

- **`my_file.csv.fail.bis`**: This file is created during the **second pass** (the `--fail` run), which retries the records from the `.fail` file using a single worker. The `.fail.bis` file contains only the records that _still_ failed. These are almost always genuine data errors that you need to investigate and fix manually.

**Your workflow should be:**

1. Run your `load.sh` script (which contains the `odoo-data-flow import` commands).
2. If a `.fail.bis` file is created, open it to identify the data issue.
3. Fix the issue in your original source file or your `transform.py` script.
4. Rerun the transformation and load process.

### Record Count Mismatch

Sometimes, the number of records in your source file doesn't match the number of records created in Odoo, even if there are no errors in the `.fail.bis` file.

- **Cause:** This usually happens when your mapping logic unintentionally filters out rows. For example, using a `postprocess` function that can return an empty value for an external ID (`id` field). If the external ID is empty, the entire record is skipped without error.

- **Solution:**
  1.  **Check your `id` field**: The most common culprit is the mapping for the `id` field. Ensure it _always_ returns a non-empty, unique value for every row you intend to import.
  2.  **Use a `preprocessor`**: For complex debugging, you can use a [preprocessor function](guides/03_data_transformations.md#pre-processing-data) to add a unique line number to each row. Import this line number into a custom field in Odoo (`x_studio_import_line_number`). After the import, you can easily compare the line numbers in your source file with those in Odoo to find exactly which rows were skipped.

### Connection Errors

These errors usually happen when the `odoo-data-flow` client cannot reach your Odoo instance.

- **Error:** `Connection refused`
  - **Cause:** The `hostname` or `port` in your `conf/connection.conf` is incorrect, or the Odoo server is not running.
  - **Solution:** Double-check your connection details and ensure the Odoo instance is active and accessible.

- **Error:** `Wrong login/password`
  - **Cause:** The credentials in `conf/connection.conf` are incorrect.
  - **Solution:** Verify your `database`, `login`, and `password`.

### Odoo Access & Validation Errors

These errors come directly from Odoo when the data is not valid enough to save.

- **Error:** `AccessError`, `You are not allowed to modify this document`
  - **Cause:** The user specified by `uid` in your `conf/connection.conf` lacks the necessary permissions (e.g., Create or Write access) for the target model.
  - **Solution:** Check the user's Access Rights in Odoo's settings.

- **Error:** `ValidationError: A required field was not provided`
  - **Cause:** Your transformed CSV file is missing a column for a field marked as `required=True` on the Odoo model.
  - **Solution:** Check the model's definition in Odoo and ensure your `transform.py` script generates a value for that field.

- **Error:** `No matching record found for external id '__export__.my_external_id_123'`
  - **Cause:** You are trying to link to a related record (e.g., setting the `partner_id` on a sales order), but the external ID you are providing does not exist in the database.
  - **Solution:**
    1. Ensure you have successfully imported the parent records first.
    2. Check for typos. The prefix and value used in your `m2o_map` must exactly match the external ID of the parent record.
    3. See the section below on Import Order.

### Understanding Import Order for Relational Data

A very common reason for the `No matching record found` error is that you are trying to import records in the wrong order.

- **The Rule:** You must always import "parent" records **before** you import the "child" records that refer to them.
- **Example:** Imagine you are importing Contacts (`res.partner`) and assigning them to Contact Tags (`res.partner.category`). Odoo cannot assign a contact to the "VIP" tag if that "VIP" tag doesn't exist in the database yet.

- **Correct Import Sequence:**
  1.  **First, import `res.partner.category`**: Run a transformation and load process for your contact tags. This creates the tags and their external IDs in Odoo.
  2.  **Then, import `res.partner`**: Run a separate process for your contacts. The mapping for the `category_id/id` field can now successfully use `mapper.m2o_map` to look up the external IDs of the tags you created in the first step.

- **General Advice:** Always map out the dependencies in your data. If Model B has a Many2one field pointing to Model A, you must always import Model A first.
