# Odoo Data Flow

**A robust Python toolkit for high-performance, intelligent Odoo data workflows.**

Odoo Data Flow is a powerful and flexible library designed to simplify complex data imports and exports with Odoo. It features a smart import engine with automatic error recovery, multi-threading, and a two-pass strategy for relational data, allowing you to manage complex transformations and validations with confidence.

This library is the successor to the `odoo-csv-import-export` library, refactored for modern development practices and enhanced clarity.
