# Odoo Data Flow

**A robust, declarative library for managing complex data imports and exports with Odoo.**

Odoo Data Flow is a powerful and flexible Python library designed to simplify the import and export of data to and from Odoo. It allows you to define data mappings and transformations in a declarative way, making complex data operations manageable and repeatable.
You can easily manage complex transformations, relationships, and validations, making your data integration tasks simpler and more reliable.

This library is the successor to the `odoo-csv-import-export` library, refactored for modern development practices and enhanced clarity.
