A powerful Python library for defining robust, repeatable, and high-performance data import/export workflows for Odoo. It replaces complex, manual data preparation with a clean, "configuration-as-code" approach.

---

## Key Features

-   **Declarative Transformations:** Use simple Python scripts and a rich set of `mapper` functions to transform any source CSV or XML data into an Odoo-ready format.
-   **Two-Phase Workflow:** Cleanly separates data **transformation** from data **loading**, making complex migrations easier to manage, reuse, and debug.
-   **High-Performance CLI:** Import and export data with a clean, modern command-line interface, featuring high performance parallel processing (`--worker`), batching (`--size`), and robust error handling.
-   **Automatic Scripting:** Automatically generate shell scripts for the loading phase, ensuring a repeatable and reliable process every time.
-   **Robust Error Handling and Recovery:** Verify the number of records processed in a batch against the number successfully imported, helping to quickly identify issues.
-   **Direct Server-to-Server Migration:** Perform a complete export, transform, and import from one Odoo instance to another in a single, in-memory step with the `migrate` command.
-   **Post-Import Workflows:** Run automated actions on your data *after* it has been imported (e.g., validating invoices, registering payments) using the powerful `workflow` command.
-   **export data from Odoo** into CSV format. While specific details on export parameters are not extensively documented in the provided text, this capability complements the import functionality, offering a complete solution for Odoo data management.


## Installation

You can install _Odoo Data Flow_ via `uv` or `pip` from [PyPI]:

```console
$ uv pip install odoo-data-flow
```

## Quick Usage Example

The core workflow involves two simple steps:

**1. Transform your source data with a Python script.**
Create a `transform.py` file to define the mapping from your source file to Odoo's format.

```python
# transform.py
from odoo_data_flow.lib.transform import Processor
from odoo_data_flow.lib import mapper

my_mapping = {
    'id': mapper.concat('prod_', 'SKU'),
    'name': mapper.val('ProductName'),
    'list_price': mapper.num('Price'),
}

processor = Processor('origin/products.csv')
processor.process(my_mapping, 'data/products_clean.csv', {'model': 'product.product'})
processor.write_to_file("load.sh")
```console
$ python transform.py
```

**2. Load the clean data into Odoo using the CLI.**
The `transform.py` script generates a `load.sh` file containing the correct CLI command.

```bash
# Contents of the generated load.sh
odoo-data-flow import --config conf/connection.conf --file data/products_clean.csv --model product.product
...
```console
$ bash load.sh
```
